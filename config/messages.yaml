# FORMATTING GUIDE:
#
#   Each message has two fields:
#     text: The message content (supports Discord markdown)
#     enabled: Whether to show this message (true/false)
#
#   Discord markdown:
#     **bold**  *italic*  `code`  ***bold italic***
#
#   Variables (keep these exactly as shown):
#     {title}  {name}  {level}  {position}  {playlist}  {playlists}  {tracks}  {channel}  {command}
#
#   Custom emojis:
#     1. In Discord, type \:youremojiname: and hit send
#     2. Copy the output (should look like <:name:123456789>)
#     3. Paste it in your message
#
#   Example:
#     not_in_vc:
#       text: "<:jillgun:1234567890> Try that again."
#       enabled: true
#
# TIPS:
#   - enabled: false = action happens, no message shown
#   - enabled: true = action happens, message shown
#   - Errors are enabled by default (you need to know why something failed)
#   - Confirmations are disabled by default (you can see/hear the result)
#   - Delete this file to reset to defaults
