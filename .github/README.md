# 🍸 Jill — A Cyberpunk Bartender Discord Music Bot

A simple, robust Discord music bot that plays local audio files and supports multiple playlists, auto-cleanup, song selection, spam protection, and more.

**Choose your command style:**
- **Classic Mode** (`!play`): Text commands with automatic message cleanup
- **Modern Mode** (`/play`): Slash commands with interactive buttons and live panels

## About
Built in a neon-lit feedback loop between me and AI coding agents. I prompted,
stitched the pieces, and fine-tuned behavior; the agents generated most of the
raw code. If it sings, credit the ensemble. If it glitches, that’s on me.

---

## Features
- **Dual Command Modes**: Choose Classic (`!play`) or Modern (`/play`) during setup
- **Multiple playlists**: You're using subfolders? Now it's a playlist!
- **Spam protection**: Hammer it all you want, spam sessions, cooldowns, and guild isolation keep it sane.
- **Smart**: Jill reads the room, pauses when alone, manages herself.
- **Shuffle mode**: Toggle it on or off, she'll auto-reshuffle as well!
- **Quick search**: Just say the name or track number, works on playlists too!

**Classic Mode** (`!play`):
- Text-based commands with customizable prefix
- Automatic message cleanup after 15 seconds
- Rename commands, change prefix, full customization
- Traditional Discord bot experience

**Modern Mode** (`/play`):
- Discord's native slash commands (type `/` to see all)
- Interactive button controls (pause, skip, shuffle, etc.)
- Auto-updating control panel with live playback status
- Ephemeral messages (only you see command responses)
- Discord handles rate limiting and permissions
