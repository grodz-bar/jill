# Discord Music Bot Configuration
# Copy this file to your bot directory as ".env" and fill in your values

# Your Discord bot token (get from Discord Developer Portal)
# See Getting-Discord-Token.txt for instructions
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here

# Path to your music folder (must contain .opus files)
# Use absolute path (e.g., /home/grodz/jill/music/)
MUSIC_FOLDER=/home/YOUR-USER-NAME/jill/music/

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - Windows users: use backslashes (\) if forward slashes (/) don't work
#   Example: C:\Users\grodz\jill\music\
# - Keep your token secret - it's like a password
# - If token is leaked, reset it in Discord Developer Portal immediately
# - Paths should not have quotes around them
